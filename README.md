The objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient system for the automated detection and classification of plant diseases. Leveraging advancements in computer vision and Deep learning, the system will analyze images of plants to identify signs of disease accurately. By employing deep learning techniques, the system will categorize the detected diseases into specific classes, enabling farmers to take targeted action.
